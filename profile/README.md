# Welcome

This is a wide collaboration between people using spin Hamiltonians in one way or another aimed at simplifying the exchange of its data.

# Goal

Create a toolchain, in particular a widely adopted spin Hamiltonian file format, to facilitate interoperability between codes that work with spin Hamiltonians.
